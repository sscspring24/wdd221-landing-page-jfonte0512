      Hello, my name is Jonathan. I am a 40-year old resident of Barberton. I have a 9-year-old daughter named Angelica.
      I recently decided to go back to college and get my degree in Web Design. Later I want to finish the Computer
      Networks degree I started at IIT Tech in 2009. Hopefully, if all works out, I will finish with a Dual associate
      degree. After that I am thinking about getting degrees in a couple other fields that will benefit my future goals,
      which I have set for myself. I want to provide a future for my daughter that I never had a chance to have when I
      was growing up.<br>
      Interests of mine are. That I like play to Star Trek Online, Ark Survival, Apex Legends, Call of Duty, Madden,
      Splinter Cell, Pubg: Battlegrounds, RISK, Rainbow Six, Tony Hawk Pro Skater, World of Tanks, Diablo, Starcraft. I
      like to read books by Sherrilyn Kenyon, Tom Clancy, John Grisham, David Baldacci, James Patterson, and other
      authors also. Music, I like to listen to is Green Day, Nickelback, AC/DC, Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers,
      Kansas, and dozens of others that would take too much time and room to name. Activities I enjoy doing include
      Camping, Going to sporting events, Going to Concerts, Going out to eat, Binge watching old TV Series (I am a Huge
      Star Trek Fan so I love rewatching those shows specially), watching Fireworks, and going to amusement parks, and
      waterparks, I love just traveling around also and seeing new places. I am a huge fan of football, and my favorite
      team is the Cleveland Browns. I am a huge fan of fantasy football also. Whenever I play I usually do well.<br>
      If there is anything else, you would like to know about me feel free to contact me and get to know me. I am a
      social butterfly and love to meet new people. Thanks for taking the time to read a short story about me.
