      I am a 40-year old resident of Barberton (Unforunately). I am originally from the Cleveland area where I grew up till I was 28 and moved to crappy Barberton. I have a 9-year-old daughter named Angelica who was born on St. Patricks Day. I decided to go back to college last year and get my degree in Web Design & Development. I used to go to college at IIT Tech, but I didn't get to finish the finish the Computer Networking degree I started in 2009. So I plan to hopefully, if all works out, finish with a Dual associate degree in Web Design & Development and Computer Networking. While taking WDD121 I decided to add to my education goal. I am gonna also work on getting my Graphic Design Certificate. It is only 6 classes and I figured I could squeeze a class in here and there when I don't have other options for the degrees I working on and need a class to fill a spot. After that I am thinking about getting degrees in a couple other fields that will benefit my future goals, which I have set for myself. I want to provide a future for my daughter that I never had a chance to have when I was growing up.

      Interests of mine are. That I like play to Star Trek Online, Ark Survival, Apex Legends, Call of Duty, Madden, Splinter Cell, Pubg: Battlegrounds, RISK, Rainbow Six, Tony Hawk Pro Skater, World of Tanks, Diablo, Starcraft. I like to read books by Sherrilyn Kenyon, Tom Clancy, John Grisham, David Baldacci, James Patterson, and other authors also. Music, I like to listen to is Green Day, Nickelback, AC/DC, Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kansas, and dozens of others that would take too much time and room to name. Activities I enjoy doing include Camping, Going to sporting events, Going to Concerts, Going out to eat, Binge watching old TV Series (I am a Huge Star Trek Fan so I love rewatching those shows specially), watching Fireworks, and going to amusement parks, and waterparks, I love just traveling around also and seeing new places. I am a huge fan of football, and my favorite team is the Cleveland Browns. I am a huge fan of fantasy football also. Whenever I play I usually do well.
      
      Why I am interested in Web Design & Development? Well I am interested in it because as a gamer I was always seeing people create these really cool websites and overlays for their streaming channels. I thought that seemed really cool and I became interesed in learning how to do that for myself. People always wanted a lot of money to create stuff for people so I figured why pay someone when I can learn it for myself and can make money off my skills also! Last summer I seen someone offering anyone $2,000 to Create and Design a website for their business. I know I won't make that kind of money off everyone, but I like to look at things positively and hope I will have chances like that in the future. Making money like that would change my life as I currently live on a fix income. Thanks to WDD121 I used my Portfolio Project to help a small business and have started creating a website for a dog grooming business. I am doing the work on it for free cause I wanted to help someone out who could really use it since they are a small business that is less than a year old and could benefit from the help to succeed themselves. I love to help people when I can.
      
      If there is anything else, you would like to know about me feel free to contact me and get to know me. I am a social butterfly and love to meet new people. Thanks for taking the time to read a short story about me.
